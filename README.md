# Snake

I can't think on a better language to implment a snake game than Python (:snake:).

# TODOs

- [x] Implement the basics for the snake's mechanics;
- [x] Implement the logic for the snake's food;
- [x] Implement collision detection + score system;
- [x] Grow the snake's body and speed when scoring;
- [ ] Crossing the window's boundaries showing the snake on the opposite side;
- [x] Make sure the snake's movement mechanics work at any speed;
- [ ] Detect collision between the snake's head and its own body;
- [ ] Make sure the food doesn't appear at the score's spot.
